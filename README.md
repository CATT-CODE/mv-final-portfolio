## Portfolio Introduction

### Who Am I?

Hello! My name is Teanna, and I am a passionate and driven data enthusiast. My journey in technology began with traditional web development at a code bootcamp, where I first discovered the joy of creating solutions that seamlessly blend functionality and user experience. Since then, my love for technology has only deepened, and I've found myself particularly drawn to the world of data engineering and machine learning. Outside of work, Iâ€™m a proud cat lover, always seeking that perfect balance between my love for technology and my furry companions.

### Why I Do What I Do

I find the field of data engineering to be both mentally challenging and creatively fulfilling. The ability to turn complex datasets into actionable insights is not just a job; it's a passion that keeps me engaged and motivated. Working in this field allows me to explore the intersection of creativity and logic, where I can design solutions that are both innovative and practical. Every day is an opportunity to learn something new, and I thrive on the challenges that this dynamic industry presents.

### The Teams I've Worked On

During my apprenticeship, I had the privilege of working with the Data Factory team at Warner Music Group. This experience allowed me to dive deep into the development and optimization of a proprietary serverless ELT framework. Our framework was designed to gather data from a multitude of sources, making it accessible and useful for various departments across the organization. This hands-on experience gave me a comprehensive understanding of how data flows within a large enterprise and how to ensure its accuracy, security, and accessibility.

### My Areas of Interest

My areas of interest have expanded significantly during my time at Warner Music Group. I am particularly passionate about Data Engineering, where I can leverage my skills in AWS services, Python, SQL, and Snowflake to build robust data pipelines. Additionally, my curiosity in Machine Learning has grown, especially in the context of using ML models to monitor and enhance data pipelines. I was also responsible for creating a unit testing suite to ensure the integrity of our data processing pipelines, and I developed a code solution that utilized machine learning to monitor and optimize select pipelines. This combination of data engineering and machine learning allows me to contribute to projects that not only store and process data but also make it smarter and more valuable.
